# Infrastructure as Code: Terraform for Region Bootstrapping

***Scope***: GCP-HCP

**Date**: 2025-09-30

## Decision

We will use Terraform as the primary Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, initially scoped to region bootstrapping and foundational infrastructure deployment.

## Context

The project needs to establish a consistent, repeatable approach for infrastructure deployment and management across multiple GCP regions.

- **Problem Statement**: How to ensure consistent, reliable, and auditable infrastructure deployment across multiple regions while supporting the automation-first philosophy and regional independence architecture.
- **Constraints**: Must support multi-regional deployments, integrate with GCP services, provide state management and audit capabilities, and align with the automation-first development philosophy.
- **Assumptions**: Terraform provides the necessary capabilities for GCP infrastructure management and can scale to support the regional architecture requirements.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Terraform**: HashiCorp's Infrastructure as Code tool with extensive GCP provider support and mature state management.
2. **Google Cloud Deployment Manager**: GCP-native IaC solution with direct integration to Google Cloud services.
3. **Pulumi**: Modern IaC platform supporting multiple programming languages and cloud providers.

## Decision Rationale

* **Justification**: Terraform provides mature, well-tested infrastructure management capabilities with extensive GCP provider support. Its declarative approach aligns with the automation-first philosophy, and the large ecosystem provides proven patterns for complex multi-regional deployments. Starting with region bootstrapping provides a focused scope for initial implementation while establishing patterns for broader infrastructure management.
* **Evidence**: Terraform's HCL provides clear, readable infrastructure definitions that support the team collaboration requirements. The state management capabilities are essential for multi-regional deployments with potential cross-region dependencies.
* **Comparison**: Cloud Deployment Manager would create GCP vendor lock-in without significant benefits over Terraform. Pulumi's programming language approach adds unnecessary complexity for infrastructure management tasks.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Consistent, repeatable infrastructure deployments across all regions
* Version-controlled infrastructure with complete audit trails
* Strong state management capabilities for complex multi-regional architectures
* Large ecosystem of proven patterns and modules for GCP deployments
* Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated infrastructure deployment

### Negative

* Additional operational complexity for Terraform state management
* Need for team training on Terraform best practices and GCP provider specifics
* Potential vendor lock-in to HashiCorp ecosystem
* State file management challenges for distributed team collaboration

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Reliability:

* **Scalability**: Terraform supports complex multi-regional infrastructure deployments with module composition and workspace management
* **Observability**: Infrastructure changes are tracked through version control and Terraform state, providing complete audit trails
* **Resiliency**: Terraform state management enables disaster recovery and infrastructure reconstruction capabilities

### Security:
- Infrastructure as Code provides complete audit trails for all infrastructure changes
- Terraform state encryption and access controls protect sensitive infrastructure information
- Policy as Code capabilities through tools like Sentinel for compliance enforcement
- Secure secrets management integration with GCP Secret Manager

### Performance:
- Parallel resource creation and management for faster infrastructure deployment
- Dependency graph optimization for efficient resource provisioning
- State management enables incremental changes without full infrastructure recreation
- Planning capabilities allow validation of changes before execution

### Cost:
- No licensing costs for Terraform OSS (open source version)
- Potential costs for Terraform Cloud/Enterprise features if needed
- Cost optimization through infrastructure lifecycle management and automated cleanup
- Resource tagging and cost attribution through Terraform resource management

### Operability:
- Initial investment in Terraform learning and best practices development
- Simplified operational procedures through infrastructure automation
- Enhanced collaboration through shared infrastructure definitions
- Integration with existing CI/CD and automation toolchains
