# Terraform Automation Tooling: Atlantis for PR-Based Infrastructure Management

***Scope***: GCP-HCP

**Date**: 2025-10-10

## Decision

The GCP-HCP platform will adopt Atlantis as the pull request automation tool for Terraform workflows. Atlantis will be self-hosted on a global GKE cluster per environment (integration, stage, production), providing automated plan/apply workflows within the PR lifecycle while maintaining complete control over security and infrastructure. Complementary automation tooling may be added in the future for Terraform operations outside of the pull request context (e.g., scheduled operations, testing pipelines).

## Context

### Problem Statement

The GCP-HCP platform requires an automated Terraform workflow that:
- Provides PR-based plan/apply automation to streamline infrastructure changes
- Maintains security-first principles with controlled secret management
- Supports OpenTofu alongside Terraform for tooling flexibility
- Displays plan output directly in PRs for efficient developer feedback
- Minimizes vendor lock-in and operational costs
- Enables self-hosting for complete infrastructure control

### Constraints

- **Security:** Must support workload identity federation and avoid credential proliferation
- **Cost:** Preference for open-source solutions
- **Infrastructure:** Team comfortable with self-hosting on GKE or Cloud Run
- **Scale:** Must support multiple environments (integration, stage, production) and regional deployments

### Assumptions

- A global GKE cluster per environment will be created to host Atlantis
- GitHub service accounts with appropriate PATs will be configured for Atlantis
- Google Secret Manager will store credentials accessed via External Secrets Operator
- CNCF's stewardship of Atlantis ensures continued community support

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. **Atlantis (Selected)**

Open-source, self-hosted Terraform PR automation tool recently donated to CNCF (June 2024). Runs as a dedicated server that listens to GitHub webhooks and executes Terraform commands based on PR comments.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Self-hosted dedicated server (runs on GKE or Cloud Run)
- Recently donated to CNCF (June 2024), ensuring community governance
- Active development with regular releases
- Executes Terraform within the same pod as the API server
- Inline plan output in PR comments
- PR-level locking (locks entire PR lifecycle vs. apply-time only)

### 2. **Digger**

Open-source CI-native Terraform automation that runs within existing GitHub Actions workflows.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Executes Terraform via CI jobs (GitHub Actions)
- Free unlimited tier with optional $50/month support plan
- PR-level locking (locks entire PR lifecycle vs. apply-time only)
- Inspired by Atlantis design patterns

**Why Not Selected:**
- Sustainability concerns around unlimited free tier business model
- Younger project without established governance (no large foundation backing)
- Security model distributes Terraform execution across CI infrastructure

### 3. **Google Cloud Infrastructure Manager**

GCP's managed service for Terraform automation using Cloud Build orchestration.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fully managed by Google (no infrastructure to maintain)
- IAM-based authentication with service accounts
- Terraform-only (no OpenTofu support)

**Why Not Selected:**
- No inline PR plan feedback (requires navigating to Cloud Build)
- Complex setup requiring GitHub App, PAT in Secret Manager, and per-environment configuration
- Does not support OpenTofu
- Poor UX compared to inline alternatives
- Multi-deployment trigger pollution (all environments trigger on every PR)

### 4. **Terraform Cloud**

HashiCorp's SaaS platform for enterprise Terraform automation.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fully managed SaaS offering
- Private agents run in your infrastructure
- Enterprise support and SLA guarantees
- Polished UX and feature set

### 5. **Tekton**

Open-source CI/CD framework and Continuous Delivery Foundation project for creating flexible, cloud-native pipeline systems.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Event-driven architecture with EventListeners for webhook triggers
- Highly flexible and standardizes CI/CD across vendors and platforms
- Reusable Tasks (e.g., terraform-cli task) for pipeline composition
- Kubernetes-native (runs on existing GKE clusters)

**Why Not Selected:**
- Requires more setup to achieve Atlantis "out of the box" functionality
- Would need custom configuration for:
  - Event triggers to respond to GitHub PR webhooks
  - Writing plan output to PR comments
  - State locking management across PRs
  - PR lifecycle automation (plan on push, apply on merge)
- Higher operational complexity for this specific use case
- Better suited for broader CI/CD automation rather than Terraform-specific workflows

**Note:** Tekton is being evaluated separately for automated pipeline tooling (particularly for nightly end-to-end tests) and may be integrated alongside Atlantis in the future for complementary use cases.

## Decision Rationale

### Justification

Atlantis provides the optimal balance of security, cost, community support, and operational control for the GCP-HCP platform's Terraform automation needs. Its recent donation to CNCF (June 2024) demonstrates renewed community commitment and governance stability, addressing previous concerns about the project's future during HashiCorp ownership.

The self-hosted architecture aligns with the team's security-first principles by:
- Isolating Terraform execution to controlled pods with specific service account permissions
- Enabling per-environment deployments with isolated credentials (integration, stage, production)
- Avoiding credential distribution across multiple CI systems

### Evidence

**POC Validation:**
- Successfully tested workload identity federation and GCS bucket creation
- Verified inline plan output in PR comments
- Confirmed state locking mechanisms prevent concurrent modifications
- Validated compatibility with team's GitHub workflow

**Community Health:**
- CNCF sandbox project (donated June 2024)
- Active development with commits as recent as October 2025
- Regular releases (latest: 3 weeks ago as of October 2025)
- Community meetings and established governance

**Team Meeting Consensus (October 10, 2025):**
- Atlantis features influenced Digger's design, demonstrating proven patterns
- CNCF donation indicates long-term sustainability
- Self-hosting requirement is manageable with Cloud Run or GKE options
- Security model superior to CI-distributed approach for team's use case

- **Proven Reliability:** Established tool with predictable behavior and extensive documentation
- **Automated Workflows:** State locking and PR-based automation streamline infrastructure changes
- **Workload Identity Compatibility:** Verified support for GCP workload identity federation

### Negative

- **Self-Hosting Overhead:** Team must maintain Atlantis infrastructure (monitoring, upgrades, availability)
- **Initial Setup Complexity:** Requires bootstrapping global clusters, GitHub service accounts, and webhook configuration
- **Less Polished UX:** Plan output formatting not as refined as some alternatives (e.g., Digger)
- **Infrastructure Dependencies:** Requires persistent server infrastructure (global GKE cluster per environment)
- **Public Endpoint Requirement:** GitHub webhooks require publicly accessible endpoint (or ngrok for development)
- **Manual Configuration:** Atlantis YAML file in repo root requires updates when adding new Terraform workspaces
- **Limited Scheduled Operations:** No native support for scheduled provision/destroy workflows (requires external automation)
- **Backlog of Open Issues:** Period of uncertainty during HashiCorp ownership created backlog that may impact feature velocity

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Reliability

**Scalability:**
- Atlantis runs as a single-instance service per environment (not designed for horizontal scaling)
- Each environment (integration, stage, production) has isolated Atlantis deployment
- Cloud Run option available for serverless scaling if needed
- Workload scales with PR velocity, not infrastructure size
- Repository-level atlantis.yaml defines Terraform workspace paths, triggering only relevant plans

**Observability:**
- GUI interface provides job monitoring and configuration visibility
- Plan/apply output logged directly in PR comments for auditing
- State lock status visible through Atlantis web interface
- GitHub webhook delivery monitoring required to detect failures

**Resiliency:**
- Single point of failure per environment (mitigated by global cluster per environment)
- State locking prevents concurrent modification conflicts
- Automatic unlock on PR merge prevents dangling locks
- Global cluster setup ensures Atlantis availability separate from regional clusters
- No SLA guarantees (self-hosted responsibility)

### Security

- **Authentication:** GitHub webhooks authenticated via shared secret stored in Google Secret Manager
- **Authorization:** GitHub service account PATs with minimal permissions (PR read/write for specific repositories)
- **Secret Management:** Credentials stored in Google Secret Manager, accessed via External Secrets Operator using workload identity
- **Workload Identity:** Atlantis service account assumes GCP permissions via workload identity federation (no credential keys)
- **Network Security:** Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) protects Atlantis GUI with Google authentication and RBAC
- **Isolation:** Per-environment Atlantis deployments isolate credentials (integration cannot access production)
- **Least Privilege:** Service accounts scoped to minimum permissions required for Terraform operations
- **Audit Trail:** All Terraform operations logged in PR comments and GitHub audit logs

### Performance

- **Latency:** Plan/apply operations run directly in Atlantis pod (no external job queuing)
- **Concurrency:** State locking serializes operations per Terraform workspace (prevents conflicts)
- **Resource Utilization:** Terraform execution shares pod resources with API server (potential resource contention)
- **Network Performance:** Atlantis pod network access to GCP APIs and GitHub
- **Optimization:** Autopilot GKE option provides right-sized compute for Atlantis workloads

### Cost

- **Compute Costs:** GKE cluster per environment (integration, stage, production) - mitigated by autopilot for cost optimization
- **Networking Costs:** Egress charges for GitHub webhook traffic and Terraform API calls
- **Storage Costs:** GCS buckets for Terraform state storage (minimal)
- **Operational Costs:** Team time for maintenance, upgrades, and troubleshooting
- **No Subscription Fees:** Zero licensing costs compared to Terraform Cloud
- **Cost Optimization Opportunities:**
  - GKE Autopilot reduces idle compute costs
  - Cloud Run option for serverless cost model
  - Shared global cluster may host Atlantis + ArgoCD

### Operability

- **Deployment:** Helm chart or Cloud Run deployment via Terraform (bootstrapped manually per environment)
- **Maintenance:** Requires regular Atlantis version upgrades (community releases cadence)
- **Configuration Management:** Atlantis YAML file in repository root requires updates for new Terraform workspaces (make target planned)
- **Monitoring Requirements:** Need alerting for webhook failures, plan/apply errors, and state lock issues
- **Secret Rotation:** GitHub PATs and webhook secrets require rotation procedures
- **Backup/Recovery:** Terraform state in GCS (versioned buckets), Atlantis configuration in GitOps repository
- **Troubleshooting:** GUI interface simplifies debugging, but requires access through IAP authentication
